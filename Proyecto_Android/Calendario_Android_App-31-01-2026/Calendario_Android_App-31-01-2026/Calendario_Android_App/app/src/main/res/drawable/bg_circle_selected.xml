    <!-- Inner color circle (will be tinted programmatically or via another layer if static) -->
    <!-- Actually, better to just use a ring or modify the view properties programmatically (scale/border).
         But user asked for "resalta", usually a border is good.
         Let's keep the original bg_color_circle and Apply a StateListDrawable or handle selection in code by adding a border view or changing background.
         
         Easier approach for runtime dynamic colors:
         The views in layout are just View with backgroundTint.
         To highlight, we can add a white border or scale it up.
         Since they are simple Views, adding a border might require a ShapeDrawable with stroke.
         But the background is already a shape.
         
         Let's create a "selected" drawable that is valid for any color? No, color is dynamic.
         
         Strategy:
         In code, when selected:
         - Deselect others: set background back to `bg_color_circle` (no stroke)
         - Select current: set background to a new drawable `bg_color_circle_selected`? 
           But we need to keep the TINT.
           
           If we change background drawable, the `backgroundTint` might persist or need re-application.
           
           Alternative: Use a parent FrameLayout for each color and toggle a white border View visibility.
           This touches XML structure.
           
           Alternative 2: Scale up the selected view.
           
           Alternative 3: Change the background drawable to one with a stroke.
           Let's try creating `bg_color_circle_selected.xml` which has a stroke.
